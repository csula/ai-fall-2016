# CS-4660 Artificial Intelligence.

This course is introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI).

In this class, we will learn a few approaches to solve general problems
by utilizing Graph as data structure and implementing search algorithms like
BFS or DFS to find out the right actions for the problem.

More specifically, we will be implementing our own Graph data structure
and then using this Graph to implement BFS, DFS, A-star searching algorithm and
as well as other searching algorithm to find out solutions around the problem.

Why graph?

Graph can be used to solve various general problems such as path finding or
some advanced problem solving (e.g. being able to play games like chess).

## Prerequisites

This is a 400 level course. Students are expected to have strong Java programming
background at this moment.

Specifically, please have Java installed ahead of time. In addition to Java,
we will be using Gradle as the build system and dependency management.

Secondly, although not required but more recommended to have a text-editor in place
like [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/) in place.

Or if you wish to use programming IDE, please set up [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)!

Last but not lease, we will be going over the examples in class with terminal mostly,
please be familiar with using terminal and running commands.
