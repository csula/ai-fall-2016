Artificial Intelligence.

In this class, we will learn a few approaches to solve general problems 
by utilizing Graph as data structure.

More specifically, we will be implementing our own Graph data structure
and then using this data structure to implement BFS, DFS, A-star searching
algorithm.

A requirement of this class would be Java. Please be famaliar with it before
the course starts as you will be implementing in Java a lot.
