# CS-4660 Artificial Intelligence.

This course is introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI).

In this class, we will learn a few approaches to solve general problems
by utilizing Graph as data structure.

More specifically, we will be implementing our own Graph data structure
and then using this Graph to implement BFS, DFS, A-star searching algorithm and
other searching algorithm.

Why graph?

Graph can be used to solve various general problems such as path finding or
some advanced problem solving like being able to play games.

## Prerequisites

This is a 400 level course. Students are expected to have strong programming
background at this moment.

Specifically, please have Java installed ahead of time. In addition to Java,
we will be using Gradle as the build system and dependency management.

## Announcements

Please check this Github repository often as the update will be posted.
